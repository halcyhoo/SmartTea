# Smart Tea

This is some code I wrote to be run a Raspberry Pi to transform a regular electric tea kettle into a clever coffee maker! It creates a Node JS webserver that can establish websockets with remote clients. The JS code controls the process. There is a sub-process of reading the temperature that runs in Python. This was a fun project and if you are interested in duplicating any part of it, have at it! And don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have questions.
